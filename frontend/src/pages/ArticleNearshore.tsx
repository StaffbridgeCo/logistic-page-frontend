          Turnover: The Unseen Supply Chain Disruption

          Exploring how employee turnover is quietly reshaping the logistics

          <p>
            When people talk about supply chain challenges, the conversation
            usually circles around containers, freight costs, or delivery
            delays. But there’s another disruption quietly draining the
            logistics industry: employee turnover.
          </p>
          <p>
            While operations focus on moving goods across borders, many
            companies overlook the talent pipeline that makes it all possible.
            And when that pipeline leaks, the entire system feels the shock.
          </p>

          <h2>The Hidden Cost of Each Exit</h2>
          <p>
            The U.S. logistics industry has one of the highest turnover rates in
            the country. Across the sector, the average hovers above 30%, while
            in trucking it can climb to an alarming 80% annually.
          </p>
          <p>
            This isn’t just a staffing inconvenience; it’s a direct threat to
            stability. Each time an employee leaves, the cost goes far beyond a
            recruitment ad. Companies lose time, productivity, and institutional
            knowledge.
          </p>
          <p>
            In financial terms, replacing a single role can cost more than 30%
            of annual salary, sometimes even more for specialized positions.
          </p>

          <h2>Why People Really Leave</h2>
          <p>
            Turnover is often blamed on pay, but the reality is far more
            complex. Compensation plays a role, yes, but research and exit
            interviews reveal that what truly drives people out the door are
            unmet expectations around growth, recognition, and leadership.
          </p>
          <p>
            More than 70% of Millennial and Gen Z workers say they’ll leave if
            they don’t see a path forward. Meanwhile, 82% of employees report
            they don’t feel valued for their contributions. When you add in
            leadership gaps, poor communication, lack of support, and unclear
            direction, the foundation of trust begins to crumble.
          </p>
          <p>
            Burnout is the silent accelerant. In logistics, especially,
            relentless schedules, high pressure, and constant firefighting wear
            people down fast. When employees feel overworked and
            underappreciated, or when their compensation doesn’t reflect the
            effort required, resignation becomes not just a choice, but a form
            of survival.
          </p>
          <p>
            And the cost isn’t just losing a worker. In logistics, every role,
            from dispatch to warehouse to customer support, touches the supply
            chain. Disengagement spreads like a ripple: operations slow,
            mistakes multiply, and customers inevitably feel the impact.
          </p>

          <h2>The Cost of Ignoring the Problem</h2>
          <p>
            Despite knowing how expensive turnover is, many logistics companies
            don’t address it as a strategic risk.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Only 47% actively measure turnover costs.</li>
            <li>Just 3% monitor its impact on productivity.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Without visibility, the cycle repeats: companies overspend on
            hiring, underinvest in retention, and watch as performance quietly
            erodes from within.
          </p>

          <h2>The Shift: Talent as a Competitive Advantage</h2>
          <p>
            In today’s logistics landscape, efficiency isn’t driven only by
            assets like fleets or warehouses; it’s driven by people. Companies
            that succeed are those that create stable, engaged teams.
          </p>
          <p>
            That’s why nearshore staffing has become a game-changer for
            logistics leaders in the U.S. By tapping into skilled professionals
            in Latin America, companies can:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Access motivated talent aligned with their culture and time zone.
            </li>
            <li>Reduce costs without sacrificing quality.</li>
            <li>
              Implement onboarding, recognition, and career development programs
              that boost retention.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            When your workforce stays engaged, operations stabilize, costs drop,
            and customer satisfaction grows.
          </p>
